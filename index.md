The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.<br>
**Conclusion**<br>
- More Loans need to be verified which will help reduce the financial loss
- Lowering the interest rates can lead to less number of defaulters

## Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
**Problem Statement**<br>
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing covid pandemic.Understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.<br>
**Solution**<br>
Built a multi-variate linear regression model predicting the demand for bikes. The main drivers include weather,Working Day or Holiday, month and season. There is also an Year on Year increase in the demand of bikes.

## House Pricing Regression
**Problem Statement**<br>
Build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.<br>
**Solution**<br>
Built a lasso and ridge linear regression model which helped in regularizing and tuning the model. The main features predicted were Above grade (ground) living area square feet, The year the house was built the newer the building the better the price it fetches,Overall Quality of the house rated from Poor to Excellent and Finished Square Feet
